# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ’» About Me
I am Kevin Huang, an Electrical & Computer Engineering student at CU Boulder with a focus on Robotics and Embedded Systems. Iâ€™m passionate about using what I learn and have hands-on experience with circuit design, hardware-software integration, and motor control systems.

Iâ€™m deeply interested in open-source projects and robotic systems, consistently exploring ways to improve and innovate with new technologies. Some tools and languages I enjoy working with include Python, C++, Verilog, MATLAB, and OnShape.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy lifting, thrifting, and working on personal projects. I love learning new skills and always find time to explore hobbies that complement my technical expertise.

I am eager to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to the developer community while expanding my knowledge in electronics, control systems, and software development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Achievements
- Currently working on a Robotic Submarine for the Colorado Robosub project.
- Building a custom bidirectional motor control board using a Jetson Nano.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning
- Diving deeper into FPGA development and digital circuit design.
- Expanding my knowledge of PCB design and signal processing.
